# Differentiate between AI, machine learning, deep learning, generative AI, and applied AI.

## Artificial Intelligence (AI)
                             is the overarching term for creating intelligent agents,

## while Machine Learning (ML) 
                            is a subset that allows systems to learn from data without explicit programming.

## Deep Learning (DL)
                    A specialized form of ML, utilizes neural networks to analyze complex patterns in vast amounts of data. 

## Generative AI
             a type of AI that creates new content, such as images or text, based on learned patterns. 
  
## Applied AI 
            focuses on using AI technologies to solve real-world problems in specific industries, bridging the gap between theoretical AI research and practical applications.

# Define Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and outline the five steps to achieve super-intelligence.

## Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) 
                                    refers to a hypothetical AI that possesses intelligence equal to a human being. 

Unlike today's AI systems, which are designed for specific tasks (like playing chess or driving a car), AGI would be capable of understanding, learning, and applying knowledge across a wide range of areas, just as a human can.
